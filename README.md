Google Map Racing

<p>A map is like a 2D game platform containing an X and Y axis. In this app, you can drive a motorcycle on the map using your arrow keys. A Start point and an End point are given. Google Maps API provides multiple route choices. Pick one of the roads and try to drive on it. The panel on the side gives you directions and calculates how far you are from the next turn. The reason why I displayed this demo here is: This is not the typical example where you provide 2 points and google map renders the routes between them. This example uses the step by step json route and creates extra coordinates to be able to evaluate which segment is used at every moment. The extra coordinates are calculated using trigonometry (aTan) and placed inside the input json as points of the route. The script uses haversine distance to calculate distances and also translates the directions strings given by google maps api in order to display direction signs on the map.</p>
